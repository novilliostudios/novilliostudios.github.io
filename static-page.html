									<h4>What does Flutter offer?</h4>
                                    <p>Write once, run on both iPhone and Android. Making an ecosystem that integrates well with both is hard work and needs beefy support of the sort that few companies other than Google can offer. And no-one has put effort into making ReactJS compile seamlessly to both Android and iOS. Or have they? A library for building cross-platform apps - ReactXP</p>
                                    <p>Microsoft has bet heavily on ReactJS and has delivered all the major benefits of Flutter but using React. React already has a huge following and has lots of bright people contributing to it; this is more fuel for the fire. MS’s commitment includes rewriting their office suite to run on react: Microsoft Office rewrite in React.js nears completion I don’t bet on companies, I bet on people and there are a lot of people behind React. Google will have to put a lot of pretty stunning people behind Flutter to deliver as much as React+Typescript already has and for what end?<p>
									<p>If you want to build the next shiny app for the developed world, Flutter offers nothing. If you want to build for the long term and reach all the corners of the earth, Flutter has this: efficiency. Eventually React will die - its core ideas are great but the implementation is bloated. It drains batteries in rich nations and does not fit on the phones of poor nations. Like jquery, it will at some time be replaced by something much smaller and more efficient. That something might be flutter. However if you try to jump too soon you will have to live the pain of poor support and isolation.</p>
									<p>A real alternative to ReactXP for cross platform apps is ionic, built on Angular, which in turn is used by Google and Amazon. And thousands of other smaller firms. But it too is fat and will not last in its current form.</p>

                                    <h4>Importance of User Exprience Design</h4>
                                    <p>If you don’t know why you chose the colors on your website, the font in your emails, or the packaging of your product, it’s time to start asking why.
									User experience is key for small and start-up businesses as well because the site is their first impression to users. This debut matters when it comes to directing future traffic and business to your product.
									The reason we love content is because you have to have context.</p>

									<p>Creating a great product, proper marketing, and clever campaigns, all deserve a point of reference.
									That’s where context comes in, and provides the backbone to everything your company will ever say and do.
									Context makes the content relevant and provides a launching board right to your prospective customers fingertips.</p>

									<p>But that begs the question, (at least for us) how should your content look? What about your website? What colors are important and which ones will detract from your product? Should that gizmo you are selling be white or black? Where do analytics fit in to content?
									Properly defined, UX Design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product. User experience design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.
									Just think about this, the phone you are holding, the t-shirt or blouse you have on, every single pattern on every single professional site you visit was intentionally designed to make you have a certain feeling, experience, and ultimately decide on a product.</p>

									<p>This is actually complicated stuff, the best companies in the world, pay top dollar to hire UX designers for good reason. They make or break your product.
									In terms of design, user experience is just as important as visual identity. Seriously. It doesn’t matter what your site or app looks like if people don’t know how to interact with it. And moreover, they need to enjoy that interaction.
									While UX is important for any digital product, it is even more important for certain types of digital products: complex sites or applications, retail or online sales, start-up sites and businesses, small-budget projects and projects or sites that are expected to last a long time.</p>

									<p>UX is key for complex sites because users must be able to easily navigate the site and understand how to use it. Neglecting UX can result in a sloppy site that people will not come back to. Developing an interaction-rich experience will drive users back to a site.
									One of the most complex types of sites can be those that include retail or online sales. Not only does the site have to be well-organized, it also has to have clear and easy to use signals for how to make a secure purchase. This is also true of sites that are expected to be around for extended periods of time, such as retail sites.
									This same concept applies to companies with small budgets. User experience is important because it can create the momentum that propels the business forward. Remember, users decide in just a few seconds whether your site or app is worth their time. That’s the only opportunity you get to reel someone in.</p>
